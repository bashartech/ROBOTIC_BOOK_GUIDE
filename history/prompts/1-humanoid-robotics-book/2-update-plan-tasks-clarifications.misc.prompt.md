## Prompt

also update it in plan and tasks file

## Response snapshot

I have updated the `plan.md` and `tasks.md` files to reflect the clarifications regarding the chapter count (strictly 8-10 chapters) and the content level (in-depth technical explanations, real-world case studies, and advanced concepts).

- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully updated plan and tasks files according to user request.
