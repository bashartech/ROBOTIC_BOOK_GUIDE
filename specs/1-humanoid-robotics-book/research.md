# Research Findings: Humanoid Robotics Book Content Guidelines

**Feature Branch**: `1-humanoid-robotics-book`
**Date**: 2025-11-30

## Decisions & Rationale

No specific research was required for this phase, as all technical context elements were sufficiently defined in the `plan.md` and aligned with existing project constraints and known technologies. The implementation approach for RAG, Qdrant, Gemini embeddings, FastAPI, and Docusaurus is well-understood within the project context.
