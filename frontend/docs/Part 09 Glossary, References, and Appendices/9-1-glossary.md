## Key Terms from AI, Robotics, and Sensors

This glossary provides definitions for key technical terms encountered throughout the book "PHYSICAL AI AND HUMANOID ROBOTICS." Understanding these terms is fundamental to grasping the concepts of artificial intelligence, robot design, control systems, and human-robot interaction.

### General Robotics Terms

*   **Actuator**: A component of a machine that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. In robotics, actuators convert energy (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic) into mechanical force.
*   **Automata**: Self-operating machines, often resembling living beings, that pre-date modern robotics. Historically, they were complex mechanical toys or philosophical demonstrations.
*   **Bipedal Locomotion**: The ability of a robot to walk or move on two legs, mimicking human movement.
*   **Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: The number of independent parameters that define the configuration of a mechanical system. Each joint in a robot contributes to its overall DOFs.
*   **End-Effector**: The part of a robot (e.g., a gripper, a tool, a hand) that interacts with the environment to perform tasks.
*   **Humanoid Robot**: A robot with a body shape built to resemble the human body, typically with a torso, head, two arms, and two legs.
*   **Kinematics**: The study of motion of points, bodies, and systems of bodies without considering the forces that cause the motion. In robotics, it relates joint angles to end-effector positions.
*   **Middleware**: Software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system, facilitating communication and data exchange between different robot software components (e.g., ROS, ROS2).
*   **Proprioception**: The sense of the relative position of one's own body parts and strength of effort being employed in movement. In robots, this is measured by joint encoders and IMUs.
*   **Robot Operating System (ROS/ROS2)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing tools, libraries, and conventions for developing complex robot behaviors.
*   **Sensor**: A device that detects and responds to events or changes in the physical environment, converting them into measurable electrical signals (e.g., cameras, LIDAR, IMUs).
*   **Simulation Environment**: A virtual platform (e.g., Gazebo, PyBullet, Unity Robotics) used to design, test, and train robots in a safe and reproducible manner without requiring physical hardware.
*   **Trajectory Planning**: The process of generating a smooth, feasible path and corresponding motion profile (including velocities and accelerations) for a robot to follow.
*   **Uncanny Valley**: A hypothetical relation between the degree of an object's resemblance to a human being and the emotional response it evokes, where highly but imperfectly human-like objects can elicit feelings of revulsion.
*   **Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**: A concept used in dynamic stability for bipedal robots, representing the point on the ground where the robot can apply an equivalent force to maintain balance.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning Terms

*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems, including learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
*   **Behavior Tree (BT)**: A hierarchical, graphical representation of decision-making logic used in AI, offering a modular and flexible alternative to state machines for complex behaviors.
*   **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A class of deep neural networks primarily used for analyzing visual imagery, highly effective for object detection, recognition, and image processing.
*   **Deep Learning (DL)**: A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data.
*   **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal explicit programming.
*   **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: An advanced control method that uses a dynamic model of the system to predict future behavior and optimize control actions over a short time horizon.
*   **Neural Network (NN)**: A computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks, used for pattern recognition and complex data analysis.
*   **Policy Gradient**: A class of reinforcement learning algorithms that directly optimize the policy (the agent's strategy for choosing actions) by estimating the gradient of the expected reward.
*   **Q-learning**: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of taking certain actions in certain states (Q-values) to maximize future rewards.
*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: An area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize the notion of cumulative reward, learning through trial and error.
*   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: A class of neural networks designed to process sequential data, where the output from one step is fed back as input to the next, suitable for time-series data like motion or speech.
*   **Sensor Fusion**: The process of combining data from multiple sensors to obtain a more accurate, reliable, or complete understanding of the environment than would be possible using individual sensors alone.
*   **State Machine**: A mathematical model of computation that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time, transitioning between states based on events or conditions.
*   **Supervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data, with each input example paired with a desired output.
*   **Unsupervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the algorithm works with unlabeled data, seeking to find hidden patterns or structures within the data.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI)**: A set of techniques that allows human users to understand and interpret the outputs of AI models, crucial for trust and accountability.

### Ethical and Societal Terms

*   **Accountability**: The obligation of an individual or organization to account for its activities, accept responsibility for them, and disclose the results in a transparent manner. Critical for AI decision-making.
*   **Ethical AI**: The field concerned with designing, developing, and deploying AI systems in a way that respects human values, rights, and principles, avoiding harm and bias.
*   **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: A legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals within the European Union, impacting how robots handle personal data.
*   **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The study of interactions between humans and robots, focusing on designing interfaces and communication methods that enable effective and natural collaboration.
*   **Privacy by Design**: An approach to privacy that embeds privacy considerations into the design and operation of information systems, rather than treating them as an afterthought.
*   **Risk Assessment**: A systematic process of identifying potential hazards, analyzing their associated risks, and determining appropriate mitigation measures to ensure safety.
*   **Safety Standards**: Established guidelines and regulations (e.g., ISO standards) that specify requirements for the safe design, development, and operation of robots to prevent harm.
*   **Transparency**: The quality of being open, honest, and comprehensible in operations and decision-making, particularly important for AI systems to build trust.
